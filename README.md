## Usage
To play the game, simply click on any cell on the game board to reveal what's underneath. The numbers on the cells indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell. You can also right-click on a cell to mark it as a mine.

The game ends when you reveal all the cells that are not mines, or when you accidentally reveal a mine.
